Phase 3: AWS Security Groups (Firewalls for Instances) ðŸ”’
We'll create the necessary Security Groups (SGs) to control traffic to and from your EC2 instances.

Create Security Groups:

Go to the EC2 dashboard.

In the left navigation pane, under "Network & Security," click "Security Groups."

Click "Create security group."

Repeat this for each SG listed below. Ensure you select your SOC-Lab-VPC for each.

a. SOC-Lab-JumpBox-SG (Critical for Initial Access)

Description: Allows secure RDP/SSH access to the Jump Box.

Inbound rules:

Type: RDP (Port 3389)

Source: "My IP" (AWS will auto-detect your current public IP. If your IP changes, you'll need to update this, or use a CIDR for your home network).

Add another rule if using Linux Jump Box: Type: SSH (Port 22), Source: "My IP".

Outbound rules: All traffic (0.0.0.0/0) to All (::/0) - this is temporary, we'll refine it later.

b. SOC-Lab-AD-DC-SG

Description: Security Group for Active Directory Domain Controller.

Inbound rules:

Type: RDP (Port 3389), Source: SOC-Lab-JumpBox-SG (select by SG ID).

Type: LDAP (Port 389), Source: SOC-Lab-Enterprise-Subnet CIDR (10.0.10.0/24).

Type: LDAPS (Port 636), Source: SOC-Lab-Enterprise-Subnet CIDR (10.0.10.0/24).

Type: Kerberos (Port 88), Source: SOC-Lab-Enterprise-Subnet CIDR (10.0.10.0/24).

Type: DNS (Port 53), Source: SOC-Lab-Enterprise-Subnet CIDR (10.0.10.0/24).

Later, you'll add rules from SOC Tooling SGs if they need to query AD.

Outbound rules: All traffic (0.0.0.0/0) to All (::/0) - refine later.

c. SOC-Lab-Win-Endpoint-SG

Description: Security Group for Windows Endpoints.

Inbound rules:

Type: RDP (Port 3389), Source: SOC-Lab-JumpBox-SG.

Type: DNS (Port 53), Source: SOC-Lab-AD-DC-SG.

Outbound rules: All traffic (0.0.0.0/0) to All (::/0) - refine later.

d. SOC-Lab-Lin-Server-SG (If including Linux Server)

Description: Security Group for Linux Server.

Inbound rules:

Type: SSH (Port 22), Source: SOC-Lab-JumpBox-SG.

Outbound rules: All traffic (0.0.0.0/0) to All (::/0) - refine later.

e. SOC-Lab-Wazuh-Manager-SG

Description: Security Group for Wazuh Manager components.

Inbound rules:

Type: SSH (Port 22), Source: SOC-Lab-JumpBox-SG.

Type: Custom TCP (Port 1514 - Wazuh agent registration), Source: SOC-Lab-Enterprise-Subnet CIDR (10.0.10.0/24).

Type: Custom TCP (Port 55000 - Wazuh agent communication), Source: SOC-Lab-Enterprise-Subnet CIDR (10.0.10.0/24).

Type: Custom TCP (Port 9200 - OpenSearch/Elasticsearch API), Source: SOC-Lab-Tines-SG (you'll create this later).

Type: HTTPS (Port 443 - Kibana Web UI), Source: SOC-Lab-JumpBox-SG.

Outbound rules: All traffic (0.0.0.0/0) to All (::/0) - refine later.

f. SOC-Lab-TheHive-SG

Description: Security Group for TheHive.

Inbound rules:

Type: SSH (Port 22), Source: SOC-Lab-JumpBox-SG.

Type: Custom TCP (Port 9000 - TheHive Web UI), Source: SOC-Lab-JumpBox-SG and SOC-Lab-Tines-SG (for Tines to connect).

Outbound rules: All traffic (0.0.0.0/0) to All (::/0) - refine later.

g. SOC-Lab-Tines-SG (If self-hosting Tines)

Description: Security Group for Tines.

Inbound rules:

Type: SSH (Port 22), Source: SOC-Lab-JumpBox-SG.

Type: HTTPS (Port 443 or specific Tines webhook port, e.g., 8080), Source: SOC-Lab-Wazuh-Manager-SG.

If using Limacharlie Cloud Platform's direct webhook, you might need to allow HTTPS from 0.0.0.0/0 on a specific Tines webhook port, but this is less secure. Better to route through an authenticated proxy or use Tines cloud which handles this.

Outbound rules: All traffic (0.0.0.0/0) to All (::/0) - refine later.

3.5. AWS Logging & Monitoring Services (The Eyes & Ears of the SOC)
These cloud-native services provide foundational data for your SOC.

AWS CloudTrail:

Purpose: The definitive record of all API activity within your AWS account. Who did what, when, and from where. Crucial for detecting unauthorized configuration changes, privilege escalation, or resource manipulation.

Configuration: Enabled account-wide, logs sent to a dedicated S3 bucket (soc-lab-cloudtrail-logs-yourid).

Integration: Wazuh is configured to poll this S3 bucket for real-time ingestion and analysis of cloud control plane events.

VPC Flow Logs:

Purpose: Captures detailed IP traffic information for network interfaces within your VPC. Think of it as NetFlow for your AWS network. Essential for network anomaly detection, traffic analysis, and identifying suspicious connections.

Configuration: Enabled on the soc-lab-vpc, logs sent to a dedicated S3 bucket (soc-lab-vpc-flow-logs-yourid) or CloudWatch Log Group.

Integration: Wazuh is configured to ingest these logs, providing crucial network-level context for investigations.

AWS GuardDuty (Highly Recommended for Advanced Detections):

Purpose: An intelligent, managed threat detection service that continuously monitors your AWS accounts for malicious activity and unauthorized behavior. It uses machine learning, anomaly detection, and integrated threat intelligence.

Configuration: Simply enable it in your AWS account.

Integration: GuardDuty findings can be automatically sent to CloudWatch Events, which can then trigger a Lambda function to push to Wazuh or directly into Tines, enriching your SIEM with high-fidelity, AWS-specific threat intelligence.

3.6. IAM Roles & Policies (The Gatekeepers of Access)
Purpose: Defines granular permissions for EC2 instances to interact with other AWS services. This prevents instances from having overly permissive credentials.

Key Roles:

Wazuh-S3-Reader-Role: Attached to the Wazuh Manager EC2 instance, granting it s3:GetObject and s3:ListBucket permissions only on the specific S3 buckets where CloudTrail and VPC Flow Logs are stored.

Tines-AWS-Responder-Role (Optional): If Tines is configured to perform automated response actions (e.g., isolating an EC2 instance, revoking temporary credentials), it would need a role with the absolute minimum necessary permissions for those specific actions.

Principle of Least Privilege (PoLP): Every IAM role and associated policy adheres strictly to PoLP, ensuring no component has more permissions than it absolutely needs to function.
