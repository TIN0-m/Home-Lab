# Security Groups and AWS services

The Security Groups act as a gatekeeper right in front of the EC2 instances. It inspects every single piece of network traffic trying to reach or leave that instance and decides whether to allow or deny it based on a set of rules you define.

Here's a breakdown of their characteristics:

## 1. Instance-Level Control
Security Groups are associated directly with an individual network interface, and by extension, the instance. This gives you granular control over each specific instance's traffic.

## 2. Default Deny (Inbound)
When you create a new Security Group, by default, it denies all inbound traffic. You must explicitly add rules to allow any incoming connections. This adheres to the principle of least privilege by default, which is a core security best practice.

## 3. Default Allow (Outbound)
Conversely, by default, a new Security Group typically allows all outbound traffic. While convenient, for a robust security posture like a SOC lab, you'll want to modify this to restrict outbound access to only what's necessary (e.g., only allowing HTTPS to specific update servers, or agent communication to your Wazuh Manager).

## 4. Rules: Allow Only
Security Group rules are always permissive (allow rules only). You cannot create a rule to explicitly "deny" traffic. If traffic doesn't match an "allow" rule, it's implicitly denied. This is a crucial difference from traditional firewalls and AWS Network ACLs, which can have explicit "deny" rules.

## 5. Stateful ðŸ§ 
This is a very important characteristic. Security Groups are stateful. This means if you allow an inbound connection (e.g., SSH on port 22), the return traffic for that connection is automatically allowed back out, even if you don't have an explicit outbound rule for it. Similarly, if you allow an outbound connection (e.g., an instance initiating a web request on port 443), the return traffic for that request is automatically allowed back in. This simplifies rule management significantly.

## 6. Rule Evaluation
When an instance has multiple Security Groups associated with it, all the rules from all associated Security Groups are aggregated to form one logical set of rules. AWS evaluates all these rules before deciding whether to allow the traffic. There's no specific order of precedence for rules within a Security Group, as all allow rules are considered.

## Security Groups in Your SOC Lab
In your SOC Lab, Security Groups are critical:

SG: SOC-Lab-JumpBox-SG: Allows inbound SSH (port 22) or RDP (port 3389) only from your whitelisted public IP address, and allows outbound SSH/RDP to your private instances.

SG: SOC-Lab-AD-DC-SG: Allows inbound LDAP, Kerberos, DNS from your Windows/Linux endpoints (by referencing their Security Groups), and potentially outbound access for updates via the NAT Gateway.

SG: SOC-Lab-Win-Endpoint-SG: Allows inbound domain traffic from the AD DC and outbound traffic for agent communication (Wazuh, Limacharlie) and updates.

SG: SOC-Lab-Wazuh-Manager-SG: Allows inbound agent communication (ports 1514, 55000) from your endpoints and outbound communication for alerts to Tines or external services.

By meticulously configuring these Security Groups, you create a robust instance-level firewalling system that strictly controls the communication pathways within and out of your VPC, a cornerstone of your lab's security.

## AWS CloudTrail:

Purpose: The definitive record of all API activity within your AWS account. Who did what, when, and from where. Crucial for detecting unauthorized configuration changes, privilege escalation, or resource manipulation.

Configuration: Enabled account-wide, logs sent to a dedicated S3 bucket (soc-lab-cloudtrail-logs-yourid).

Integration: Wazuh is configured to poll this S3 bucket for real-time ingestion and analysis of cloud control plane events.

## VPC Flow Logs:

Purpose: Captures detailed IP traffic information for network interfaces within your VPC. Think of it as NetFlow for your AWS network. Essential for network anomaly detection, traffic analysis, and identifying suspicious connections.

Configuration: Enabled on the soc-lab-vpc, logs sent to a dedicated S3 bucket (soc-lab-vpc-flow-logs-yourid) or CloudWatch Log Group.

Integration: Wazuh is configured to ingest these logs, providing crucial network-level context for investigations.

## AWS GuardDuty (Highly Recommended for Advanced Detections):

Purpose: An intelligent, managed threat detection service that continuously monitors your AWS accounts for malicious activity and unauthorized behavior. It uses machine learning, anomaly detection, and integrated threat intelligence.

Configuration: Simply enable it in your AWS account.

Integration: GuardDuty findings can be automatically sent to CloudWatch Events, which can then trigger a Lambda function to push to Wazuh or directly into Tines, enriching your SIEM with high-fidelity, AWS-specific threat intelligence.

## 3.6. IAM Roles & Policies (The Gatekeepers of Access)
Purpose: Defines granular permissions for EC2 instances to interact with other AWS services. This prevents instances from having overly permissive credentials.

Key Roles:

Wazuh-S3-Reader-Role: Attached to the Wazuh Manager EC2 instance, granting it s3:GetObject and s3:ListBucket permissions only on the specific S3 buckets where CloudTrail and VPC Flow Logs are stored.

Tines-AWS-Responder-Role (Optional): If Tines is configured to perform automated response actions (e.g., isolating an EC2 instance, revoking temporary credentials), it would need a role with the absolute minimum necessary permissions for those specific actions.

Principle of Least Privilege (PoLP): Every IAM role and associated policy adheres strictly to PoLP, ensuring no component has more permissions than it absolutely needs to function.
